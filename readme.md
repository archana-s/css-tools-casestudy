# Project files for O'Reilly Learning Path: Applying and Measuring Your CSS Against Your Style Guide
This includes all the js files used in the [O'Reilly course](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/applying-and-measuring/9781491994108/)
There is no set up needed. You can run the examples by copying the js files and running them on your CSS files. 

The two files that are used in the course material are:
* [runCSSStats.js](https://github.com/archana-s/css-tools-casestudy/blob/master/runCSSStats.js) - This uses CSSStats package to give stats on any given CSS
* [runColorguard.js](https://github.com/archana-s/css-tools-casestudy/blob/master/runColorguard.js) - This catches color collisions for any given CSS
